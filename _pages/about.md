I am a Computer Engineering graduate (CGPA:3.57/4.00) with a strong interest in applied machine learning, secure networks, computer vision, and Interdisciplinary research. My academic journey has been shaped by a passion for solving real-world problems through research, innovation, and teaching.

I have worked on projects spanning 3D mapping for infrastructure inspection, intelligent systems, and data science, and I continue to explore how AI/ML and embedded systems can be leveraged for impactful applications. I also bring experience in teaching and mentoring, having organized multiple Python programming and Data Structures & Algorithms camps.

Beyond academics, I actively participate in global competitions, including an international hackathon win and completing challenges in mutliple events, reflecting my enthusiasm for collaborative problem-solving.

My long-term goal is to pursue a PhD.
